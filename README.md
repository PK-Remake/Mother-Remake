## [MOTHER Remake](https://forum.starmen.net/forum/Community/PKHack/Mother-Remake/first)


This is a provisional repository for assets and code gathered together from the PK Hack community's collective MOTHER Remake project, for eventual and subsequent continuation of the project in case of a worst-case scenario.

In the event that the project's developer [H.S](https://forum.starmen.net/members/H-S/posts) comes back, this repository will be updated with the actual source of the project if he agrees.

## Instructions

The project is currently a Work In Progress and is being built on from previous obtained assets from the Mother Remake by H.S.

It can be compiled by using CoilSnake and using the "coilsnake-project" as the Project Path for it. (The hack also has support for MSU-1, but no tracks have been made for this project specifically)
